Play 2.1.1 Testing Examples
===========================

As presented on the Play User Group Berlin 2013-04-15.

Applications
------------

  * __test-app__: generated via `play new` and enhanced with some tests
  * __zentasks__: part of Play 2.1.1 samples enhanced with test cases for different aspects of the application.
    Two test cases fail or are commented out using `pendingUntilFixed` because global database setup has been removed from the application.
